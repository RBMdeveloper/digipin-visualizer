DIGIPIN (Digital PIN) is a grid-based geospatial location code system developed by the Department of Telecommunications and India Post to replace traditional postal PIN codes with accurate, digital geographic references.  The system divides the Indian subcontinent into hierarchical grid tiles using a 4x4 matrix at each level.
